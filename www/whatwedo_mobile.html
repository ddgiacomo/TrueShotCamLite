		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;font-size:12px;">
			True Shot CAM (TSC) is a smartphone camera app and digital image verification system. 
			When you need to prove the authenticity of digital images, you need True Shot CAM.<br>
			There is nothing easier to manipulate than a digital image. Don’t be tricked or fooled by other people’s images. 
			Prove to others that your images are authentic utilizing TSC.<br>
			With digital images, seeing is not always believing.<br> 
			•	When you send a digital image to someone, how do you prove to them that it is authentic? <br> 
			•	When someone sends a digital photo to you, how do you know it was not altered in Photoshop to fool you or defraud you? <br><br>
		</p> 
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;text-align:center;font-size:12px;">
			The answer is True Shot CAM<br>
			Dismiss speculation<br>
			&<br>
			Prove the validity of your photos
		</p><br>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"> 
			What exactly is True Shot CAM? When you take photos and videos using your smartphone, 
			True Shot CAM assigns an identifying number and also stamps the photo or video with the time, date, and GPS coordinates 
			(plus you may type in your own comments). Once a photograph is taken, it is automatically registered in the system. 
			You can use True Shot CAM to compare any copy against the original image, by using its unique identification number.
		</p><br>
         <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">
			True Shot CAM is convenient. The app is downloaded to your smartphone, so you can use it where and when you want. 
			You have the option of saving your photos and videos on your True Shot CAM personal album. 
			The personal album, stored on the Cloud to give you easy and convenient access, and is kept completely private from others.<br><br>
			To confirm or verify that an image is authentic, True Shot CAM performs a careful, pixel-by-pixel comparison between the image 
			that has been registered on the True Shot CAM system and the comparison image that you upload.<br><br>
			Users can choose to make their uploaded photos private or public. Both types of photos can be verified. 
			Yet, only public photos can be searched and viewed by other users.<br><br>
			Images can lie. Don’t let them. Use True Shot CAM to register, certify, track, and validate images.

			<h3>Technical specifications step by step</h3><br>
			How to verify or search photos.<br>
			Authentication of photos is done in the following way.<br>
			ATTENTION. Photos must be recorded using True Shot CAM to be authenticated and verifiable by True Shot CAM.<br>
		</p><br>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; padding-left:10px;">
			1.	Photo will be taken utilizing the TSC system<br>
			2.	Photos will be stamped with the accurate date, time, location and coordinates. 
			Time and date will depend on location for accuracy. (stamp; BOLD)<br> 
			3.	Photos will allow the user to manually stamp a comment on the photo (watermark)<br>
			4.	Photos will be automatically stamped with a unique serial number (stamp; BOLD)<br>
			5.	TSC’s linear security system uses a set of 3 perpendicular and 3 horizontal lines that run across the photo. 
			These security lines will be inscribed with the serial number.<br> 
			6.	Photos will be labeled with the contact information of the person who took the photo (the user). 
			Contact information may include name, Email, twitter, Facebook, phone number, etc. [OPTIONAL](watermark)<br>
			7.	The photos will be saved privately and securely on the user’s True Shot CAM personal album and Database. [OPTIONAL]<br>
			8.	The user can from this point share the photo on various social networks such as: Facebook, twitter, email, tumbler, 
			Pinterest, etc.<br>
			9.	All photos can be verified, and in some cases searched by the TSC SYSTEM. Once a photo has being taken using TSC, 
			the user may visit the “verification and search” page on the website or smartphone application, and use the “verification and search” 
			box.<br>
			10.	 To verify a photo, the user must submit the serial number twice, and then, the user must submit the photo that he or 
			she is trying to verify.<br>
			11.	 The TSC system looks for the photo with the same serial number. Then, the TSC system compares the submitted photo to 
			the photo in the TSC database with the same serial number, in a pixel to pixel comparison, and by using other tests.<br>
			12.	The TSC verification page will then show a result by displaying two images next to each other. 
			The first image will be the submitted image. The second image will show a black spot on the changed or altered part, 
			if the photo happens to be changed or fake. And, there will be a stamp with the phrase “CHANGED” on top of the second image. 
			But, if the submitted photo or image matches the material on the TSC SYSTEM, the second image will be stamped with the word 
			“ORIGINAL.”<br><br>
		</p><br>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">
			The TSC system allows the user to look up photos using “SEARCH” by submitting the serial number; however, this may only work 
			if the photo’s privacy settings are on “PUBLIC” mode, within the TSC system. This will allow the person searching the photo 
			to view the photo and in some cases download it.<br>
			Confirm the validity and legitimacy of your photos with True Shot CAM’s secure and reliable system using your smartphone.
